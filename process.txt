Have list of BC + Vi
Have other, fixed params (wind speed, sight height, atmospherics, etc)

Foreach (BC + Vi):
    Foreach x in range(someMin, someMax):
        Generate yardages with x as ZERO
    Find ideal 0 yardage candidates (use good_zero function)
    Find best candidate



* ideal function possibilites:

def good_zero(elevation, min_elevation, max_elevation, bullet_diam)->bool:
    return elevation >= min_elevation and elevation + half-diameter-of-bullet <= max_elevation 

range of good zeros = 
    * zero is the first point at which the bullet passes line of sight
    * we are adjusting sighting to change that point
    the peak rises(elevations) that satisfy some constraint
